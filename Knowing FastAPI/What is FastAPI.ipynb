    "### What is FastAPI?\n",
    "\n",
    "- FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+\n",
    "\n",
    "- Designed to create APIs quickly and efficiently with minimal code and maximum performance\n",
    "\n",
    "- Built on top of Starlette (for web handling) and Pydantic (for data validation)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses Python type hints to enable automatic validation, code completion, and error checking\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automatically generates interactive API documentation using Swagger UI and ReDoc\n",
    "\n",
    "- Built-in data validation and async support (via Pydantic and async/await syntax)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supports dependency injection for clean, testable, and reusable components\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extensible and modular architecture, suitable for small and large projects alike"

    "### why fastapi?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Blazing fast performance – Comparable to Node.js and Go\n",
    "\n",
    "- Based on Python type hints – Clear, readable, and IDE-friendly code\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automatic data validation – Uses Pydantic to validate request and response data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Auto-generated API documentation – Swagger UI and ReDoc are built-in\n",
    "\n",
    "- Async/await support – Perfect for building non-blocking, high-performance APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dependency Injection system – Makes authentication, database access, and reusable logic cleaner\n",
    "\n",
    "- Testing made easy – Great support for unit testing and mocking\n",
    "\n",
    "- Microservices ready – Ideal for building modular, scalable APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "- Built-in JSON support – Automatically parses requests and formats responses as JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "- Leverages full Python ecosystem – Works smoothly with NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Great for mobile app backends, AI/ML APIs, IoT devices, and more\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easy integration with OAuth2, JWT, and other authentication methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supports background tasks, CORS, WebSockets, and middleware out of the box"

    "### Why FastAPI is Fast?\n",
    "1. Based on Starlette (High-Performance ASGI Framework)\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI is built on Starlette, which uses ASGI to handle many concurrent requests efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Asynchronous by Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Native support for async and await allows FastAPI to process multiple requests without blocking.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Pydantic for Fast Data Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Pydantic enables fast and type-safe request and response validation using optimized Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Compiled with Uvicorn\n",
    "\n",
    "Uvicorn uses uvloop and httptools to provide extremely fast request handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Automatic Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "API documentation is generated directly from code without additional runtime overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Type Hints = Speed and Safety\n",
    "\n",
    "Type hints improve validation efficiency while keeping the code readable and safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Dependency Injection System\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependencies are efficiently managed and reused, reducing unnecessary computation."

    "### How FastAPI Works?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Client Sends an HTTP Request\n",
    "\n",
    "A client sends an HTTP request such as GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE to the FastAPI server.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Request Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI matches the request URL and HTTP method to the appropriate path operation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dependency Resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "Required dependencies are automatically resolved using FastAPI’s dependency injection system.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Request Data Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Incoming data (query parameters, request body, headers, etc.) is validated using Pydantic models.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Execution of Business Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "The path operation function executes application logic such as database operations or data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Response Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "The function returns a response, usually JSON, which FastAPI automatically serializes.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Automatic API Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "All routes are automatically documented and available at /docs and /redoc.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Asynchronous Execution Support\n",
    "\n",
    "Supports async functions for non-blocking I/O operations and better concurrency.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Error and Exception Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation errors and exceptions are handled gracefully using built-in and custom handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Testable and Modular Design\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI is designed to be easy to test, maintain, and scale into larger services."
