Why Organizing Code
1. Scalability: Makes it easy to add new features without breaking existing ones.
2. Readability: Clean folder structure improves understanding for new developers.
3. Maintainability: Easier to locate bugs, fix issues, and update specific parts of the project.
4. Collaboration Friendly: Teams can work on different parts of the codebase without conflict.
5. Testing Made Easy: Organized code simplifies writing and running unit or integration tests.
6. Professional Standard: Reflects real-world industry practices and clean architecture principles.
7. Reusability: Common utilities or logic can be reused across modules (via utils, dependencies, etc.)
