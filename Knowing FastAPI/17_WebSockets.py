What is a WebSocket?
    - A communication protocol that enables "full-duplex" (two-way) communication between a client and a server.
    - Unlike HTTP, it keeps the connection open, allowing real-time data exchange.
    - Uses a single TCP connection for sending and receiving messages.
    - Starts as an HTTP handshake, then upgrades to the WebSocket protocol.
